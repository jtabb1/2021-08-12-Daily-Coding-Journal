    <p> 
      Today I am going to go to my Amazon.com job, work on my 
      non-Amazon job, and squeeze in time to practice on coding or 
      work on my project as exemplified by commits or new repos in 
      github. 

      I have already worked on efforts to get a better or more suitable job for me at Amazon.com today.
